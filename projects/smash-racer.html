              <p>
                I had two weeks to solo create a game in my class, and the only specifications was
                that it had to be a game with a unique mechanic. In this case, my unique mechanic was a
                sideways dash that could destroy other cars in a never-ending racing game. 
                It's a fairly straightforward game, and it was designed to feel very fast and 
                out of control by the time you die.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout the two weeks, I only had one time of outside feedback from my class, which was
                in the middle of the two weeks. From that feedback, I had to iterate on my design and
                improve the game and interestingness of the mechanic. One major bit of feedback I got was that
                performance wasn't great on many people's machines, so I had to adjust lighting and after effects
                until it was stable and running smoothly on even a potato. Unfortunately, due to the time crunch, 
                this meant some of the lighting felt off in the end, but the usability was much, much better. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Some key systems I had to build:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    An autopilot mechanism both for enemies and for the player when they are in the shop
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Endless road generation so that it never hits itself and appears like one seemless road
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Generating and managing coins, light pillars, and enemies such that they always appear on the track and have good, yet increasing, spawn rates as the player continues
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Lots of "juice" so that dashing into enemies, using powerups, entering/exiting the shop, taking damage, and general movement feels good and immersive to the player
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    All art assets, created using blender (which I learned for this project), and paint programs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Increasing speed and difficulty of the game at a steady pace such that the player doesn't feel too difficult of a spike, but the game still gets more difficult.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
