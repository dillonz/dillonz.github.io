              <p>
                Keilgoure was the game three friends and I put together in one day for the 2023 GMTK Game Jam with a theme of Roles Reversed. Given our schedules, we only had one day to do it, and two of my three teammates had never used Unity before, so I
                also had the opportunity to teach them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The game was created to be a reverse roguelike, where the player is an ememy in the dungeon, trying to protect the loot in the procedurally generated map from the hero breaking in. They did this by fighting the monsters and getting 
                their abilities and stat upgrades before the hero can get to them so that when the hero does come to fight, the player is ready.
              </p>
